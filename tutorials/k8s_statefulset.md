# Kubernetes StatefulSet and Storage

In this tutorial, we will deploy **Prometheus** as a StatefulSet backed by an AWS EBS persistent volume, so that collected metrics data survives Pod restarts and rescheduling.

## Persistent Storage

So far, Pods in the cluster were ephemeral - when a Pod restarts, all files written during its lifetime are lost.

For a monitoring tool like Prometheus, this means losing all historical metrics data every time the Pod is rescheduled or updated.

Kubernetes solves this with [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/): a piece of durable storage bound to a Pod so that data lives beyond the Pod's lifetime.
In our case, the backing storage will be an **AWS EBS (Elastic Block Store)** volume.

## The AWS EBS CSI Driver

The [Container Storage Interface (CSI)](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec) is a standard API between container orchestrators (like Kubernetes) and storage systems (like AWS EBS).

The **AWS EBS CSI Driver** is a plugin that allows Kubernetes to:

- Attach and detach EBS volumes to/from EC2 nodes.
- Mount and unmount EBS volumes inside Pods.
- (Optionally) create and delete EBS volumes dynamically on demand.

Without this driver, Kubernetes has no way to communicate with AWS to manage EBS volumes.
The nodes already carry the `kubeadm-cluster-node-role` IAM role, which grants the necessary EBS permissions.

### Install the EBS CSI Driver

Install the driver into your cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver/deploy/kubernetes/overlays/stable/?ref=release-1.60"
```

Verify the driver pods are running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=aws-ebs-csi-driver
```

### Create a StorageClass for EBS

A **StorageClass** describes the type of storage and how it is provisioned. Create one for `gp3` EBS volumes:

```yaml
# k8s/ebs-storage-class.yaml

apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: ebs-sc
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
allowVolumeExpansion: true
parameters:
  type: gp3
```

`volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer` tells Kubernetes to delay volume binding until a Pod is scheduled, ensuring the EBS volume is created in the same Availability Zone as the node.

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/ebs-storage-class.yaml
```

## Storage Concepts

Before provisioning storage for Prometheus, let's understand the three key objects involved:

- **PersistentVolume (PV)** - a piece of storage in the cluster, representing a physical disk (such as an AWS EBS volume). Pods cannot use a PV directly.
- **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)** - a *request* for storage. Pods bind to a PVC, which binds to a PV. This indirection **decouples** storage management from Pod specification: Pods can request storage without knowing the underlying infrastructure.
- **StorageClass (SC)** - describes a "class" of storage and its provisioner. For example, a StorageClass for AWS EBS `gp3` volumes backed by the EBS CSI driver.

![k8s_statefulset_and_storage_summary][k8s_statefulset_and_storage_summary]

We will use **static provisioning**: manually create an EBS volume, create a PV pointing to it, then create a PVC that claims it.

## Step 1 - Create an EBS Volume in AWS

First, find the Availability Zone of your worker node:

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.metadata.labels.topology\.kubernetes\.io/zone}{"\n"}{end}'
```

Then create a 5 GiB `gp3` EBS volume in the **same AZ** (replace `<az>` with your node's AZ, e.g. `eu-central-1a`):

```bash
aws ec2 create-volume \
  --volume-type gp3 \
  --size 5 \
  --availability-zone <az> \
  --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=volume,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=prometheus-data}]'
```

Note the `VolumeId` from the output (e.g. `vol-0a1b2c3d4e5f67890`). You will need it in the next step.

## Step 2 - Create a PersistentVolume (PV)

Create a PV that points to your EBS volume. Replace `<volume-id>` with the actual EBS volume ID:

```yaml
# k8s/prometheus-pv.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: prometheus-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: ebs-sc
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  csi:
    driver: ebs.csi.aws.com
    volumeHandle: <volume-id>
    fsType: ext4
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/prometheus-pv.yaml
kubectl get pv
```

The PV status should be `Available`.

## Step 3 - Create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)

A PVC claims the PV we just created:

```yaml
# k8s/prometheus-pvc.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: prometheus-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: ebs-sc
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/prometheus-pvc.yaml
kubectl get pvc
```

The PVC status should transition to `Bound`, meaning it has been matched to the PV.

## Step 4 - Deploy Prometheus as a StatefulSet

Now deploy Prometheus as a **StatefulSet**, referencing the PVC for its data directory `/prometheus`:

```yaml
# k8s/prometheus-statefulset.yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: prometheus
spec:
  serviceName: "prometheus-service"
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: prometheus
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: prometheus
    spec:
      securityContext:
        fsGroup: 65534   # prometheus runs as user nobody (65534); ensures the volume is writable
      containers:
        - name: prometheus
          image: prom/prometheus:v2.53.0
          ports:
            - containerPort: 9090
          volumeMounts:
            - name: prometheus-storage
              mountPath: /prometheus
      volumes:
        - name: prometheus-storage
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: prometheus-pvc
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: prometheus-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: prometheus
  ports:
  - port: 9090
    targetPort: 9090
```

Apply it and verify:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/prometheus-statefulset.yaml
kubectl get pods -l app=prometheus
kubectl get pvc
```

To confirm that data is persisted, delete the Prometheus Pod and observe that the StatefulSet recreates it and remounts the same EBS volume:

```bash
kubectl delete pod prometheus-0
kubectl get pods -l app=prometheus -w
```

After the Pod restarts, all historical metrics data will still be available.

## StatefulSet characteristics

We used a StatefulSet rather than a Deployment because a StatefulSet provides:

1. **Stable, predictable Pod names** - The Pod is always named `prometheus-0`. This matters when referencing a specific Pod in configuration or scripts.
2. **Stable volume binding** - The StatefulSet ensures `prometheus-0` always remounts its own PVC after a reschedule or restart, never accidentally mounting another Pod's volume.
3. **Ordered deployment and termination** - Kubernetes starts or stops Pods one at a time in a defined order, which is essential for stateful workloads.

## Volumes and Data Protection

PVCs and PVs represent real infrastructure holding important data that you cannot afford to lose.

Kubernetes ships with a **Storage Object in Use Protection** feature:

- A PVC actively used by a Pod is not deleted until the Pod releases it.
- A PV bound to a PVC is not deleted until the PVC is removed.

**Reclaim Policy** controls what happens to the underlying EBS volume after the PV is released:

- `Retain` - The EBS volume is kept after the PV is deleted. You are responsible for cleanup. **Use this in production.**
- `Delete` - The EBS volume is deleted along with the PV.

Our `prometheus-pv` uses `Retain`, so deleting the PV will not destroy the EBS volume or its data.


# Exercises

### :pencil2: Persist Grafana data using a StatefulSet

Provision a Grafana server using a StatefulSet backed by an EBS persistent volume.
All Grafana data is stored under `/var/lib/grafana`. The server should run with 1 replica.

Follow the same steps as for Prometheus:

1. Create a 2 GiB EBS volume in AWS in the same AZ as your worker node.
2. Create a PV pointing to it.
3. Create a PVC.
4. Deploy Grafana (`grafana/grafana`) as a StatefulSet using the PVC.

Verify that your Grafana dashboards and data sources survive a Pod deletion.

### :pencil2: (optional) Dynamic volume provisioning

In the previous steps you created the EBS volume manually and referenced it in a PV.
Kubernetes also supports **dynamic provisioning**: you only create a PVC, and the EBS CSI driver automatically creates both the EBS volume in AWS and the corresponding PV object — no manual `aws ec2 create-volume` needed.

Repeat the Grafana exercise above using dynamic provisioning:

1. Instead of creating an EBS volume and a PV manually, create only a PVC that references the `ebs-sc` StorageClass.
2. Deploy Grafana as a StatefulSet using the PVC.
3. Observe that once the Pod is scheduled, the PVC transitions to `Bound` and a PV is automatically created by the EBS CSI driver.

> [!NOTE]
> Because the `ebs-sc` StorageClass uses `volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer`, the PVC stays in `Pending` until a Pod that uses it is scheduled. At that point the EBS volume is created in the same Availability Zone as the node.

### :pencil2: (optional) Increase volume capacity

Assume the Prometheus volume is running low on disk space. This exercise guides you through properly resizing a Kubernetes volume.

Resizing is done by editing the **PersistentVolumeClaim** object. Never delete and recreate PV/PVC objects to increase size - this risks data loss.

The `ebs-sc` StorageClass already has `allowVolumeExpansion: true`, so you can increase the storage request in the PVC directly:

```bash
kubectl edit pvc prometheus-pvc
```

Kubernetes will interpret the change as a volume expansion request and trigger automatic resizing via the EBS CSI driver.

Once the PVC shows the condition `FileSystemResizePending`, restart the Pod to complete the file system resize on the node:

```bash
kubectl delete pod prometheus-0
```

Once complete, the PVC will automatically reflect the new size:

```bash
kubectl get pvc prometheus-pvc
```
