# Docker compose brief

Are you tired by executing `docker run`, `docker build`? so are we.

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services. 
Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

A `docker-compose.yaml` looks like this:

```yaml
services:
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
      - prometheus-data:/prometheus

  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - grafana-data:/var/lib/grafana
volumes:
  grafana-data:
  prometheus-data:
```

The given Docker Compose file describes a multi-service application with two services: `prometheus` and `grafana`. 

## Compose benefits 

Using Docker Compose offers several benefits:

- **Simplified Container Orchestration**: Docker Compose allows for the definition and management of multi-container applications as a single unit.
- **Reproducible Environments**: Since compose is defined in a YAML file, it's easy to deploy the same environment in different machine without missing any `docker run` command. This ensures that the application runs consistently across different machines.
- **Automate Volumes and Networking**: Docker Compose automatically creates a network for the application and assigns a unique DNS name to each service. No need to create networks and volumes. 


# Exercises

## :pencil2: YoloService + YoloFrontend + Monitoring Stack

In this exercise you will compose a full multi-service application:

- **YoloService** - the object detection backend (you've built the image yourself).
- **YoloFrontend** - a web UI that talks to YoloService (you'll build this image yourself too).
- **Prometheus** - scrapes metrics from YoloService.
- **Grafana** - visualises the Prometheus metrics.

The final network architecture looks like the following - you will create two custom networks and connect the services accordingly:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────────────────┐
│        yolo-net             │     │        monitoring-net        │
│                             │     │                              │
│  yolo-frontend ──► yolo     │     │  prometheus ──► grafana      │
│                   service   │◄────│  (prometheus also joins      │
└─────────────────────────────┘     │   yolo-net to scrape metrics)│
                                    └──────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Notes

- Source code for the YoloService is https://github.com/alonitac/YoloService. **Important** - You should fetch new changes from the repo (run `git reset --hard origin/main` from the `YoloService` directory) and rebuild the image to get the YoloFrontend talking with YoloService.
- You've already cloned and built the `yolo-frontend` image in the previous exercise - reuse it here.
- **Alternatively**, you can use the `alonithuji/yolo-frontend:0.0.2` for the frontend, and `alonithuji/yolo-service:0.0.2` for the backend, which are available on DockerHub.
- `yolo-frontend` and `yolo-service` should both be attached to `yolo-net`. The frontend container should reach the backend using the `yolo-service` hostname by setting the `YOLO_API_URL` environment variable to `http://yolo-service:8080`.
- Both grafana and prometheus should persist data, as done in the previous exercise.

Start the stack by:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Now you should open `http://<your-ec2-ip>:3000` in your browser and send an image through the YoloFrontend UI.

to stop the stack, run:

```bash
docker compose down        # stops and removes containers, but NOT volumes
```
