# Amazon Web Services (AWS) - Intro to Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is a technology that allows businesses and individuals to access and use computing resources over the internet, without the need for owning or maintaining physical hardware. 
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leading provider of cloud computing services, offering a wide range of tools and platforms that enable businesses to deploy, scale, and manage their applications and data in the cloud.
With AWS, organizations can benefit from the flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of cloud computing, while focusing on their core business objectives.

## Region and Zones

AWS operates state-of-the-art, highly available data centers. Although rare, failures can occur that affect the availability of instances that are in the same location. If you host all of your instances in a single location that is affected by a failure, none of your instances would be available.

Each **Region** is designed to be isolated from the other Regions. This achieves the greatest possible **fault tolerance** and **stability**.


In this course we will use the `us-east-1` (N. Virginia) region *only*.

The `us-east-1` region (and all other regions) has multiple, isolated locations known as **Availability Zones**. The code for Availability Zone is its Region code followed by a letter identifier. For example, `us-east-1a`, `us-east-1b`, `us-east-1c`, etc.

*In the AWS web console, please make sure you are operating in the `us-east-1` region. You can check this in the top right corner of the console, next to your account name.*


## Launch a virtual machine (EC2 instance) 

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. 
It allows users to create and manage virtual machines, commonly referred to as "instances", which can be launched in a matter of minutes and configured with custom hardware, network settings, and operating systems.

![][networking_project_stop]

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

2. From the EC2 console dashboard, in the **Launch instance** box, choose **Launch instance**, and then choose **Launch instance** from the options that appear\.

3. Under **Name and tags**, for **Name**, enter a descriptive name for your instance\.

4. Under **Application and OS Images \(Amazon Machine Image\)**, do the following:

   1. Choose **Quick Start**, and then choose **Ubuntu**\. This is the operating system \(OS\) for your instance\.
   
5. Under **Instance type**, from the **Instance type** list, you can select the hardware configuration for your instance\. Choose the `t3.medium` instance type (the cheapest one). In Regions where `t3.medium` is unavailable, you can use a `t2.medium` instance.

6. Under **Key pair \(login\)**, choose **create new key pair** the key pair that you created when getting set up\.

   1. For **Name**, enter a descriptive name for the key pair\. Amazon EC2 associates the public key with the name that you specify as the key name\.

   2. For **Key pair type**, choose either **RSA**.

   3. For **Private key file format**, choose the format in which to save the private key\. Since we will use `ssh` to connect to the machine, choose **pem**.

   4. Choose **Create key pair**\.
   
     **Important**  
     This step should be done once! once you've created a key-pair, use it for every EC2 instance you are launching. 

   5. The private key file is automatically downloaded by your browser\. The base file name is the name you specified as the name of your key pair, and the file name extension is determined by the file format you chose\. Save the private key file in a **safe place**\.
      
      **Important**  
      This is the only chance for you to save the private key file\.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are working on a university lab computer, make sure to store your files on your personal **S:/** drive or on `\\spaceware.bgu.ac.il\` - files saved locally on lab computers may be deleted between sessions.

7. Next to **Network settings**, choose **Edit**\. 

   1. For **VPC** choose the default VPC fo your region.
   2. For **Subnet** choose any subnet you want. 
   3. Choose **Create security group** while providing a name other than `launch-wizard-x`. 


8. Under **Configure storage**, set the root volume size to **15 GiB**\.


9. Keep the default selections for the other configuration settings for your instance\.

10. Review a summary of your instance configuration in the **Summary** panel, and when you're ready, choose **Launch instance**\.

11. A confirmation page lets you know that your instance is launching\. Choose **View all instances** to close the confirmation page and return to the console\.

12. On the **Instances** screen, you can view the status of the launch\. It takes a short time for an instance to launch\. When you launch an instance, its initial state is `pending`\. After the instance starts, its state changes to `running` and it receives a public DNS name\.

13. It can take a few minutes for the instance to be ready for you to connect to it\. Check that your instance has passed its status checks; you can view this information in the **Status check** column\.

> [!NOTE]
> When stopping the instance, please note that the public IP address may change, while the private IP address remains unchanged


To connect to your instance, open the terminal in your local machine, and connect to your instance by: 

```shell
ssh -i "</path/key-pair-name.pem>" ubuntu@<instance-public-dns-name-or-ip>
```

# Exercises

## :pencil2: EC2 instance security group

AWS uses **Security Groups** as virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic to your EC2 instances.
By default, a new security group allows **only port 22 (SSH)** for inbound traffic - everything else is blocked.

> Why do you think only port 22 is open by default?

To allow other types of traffic, you need to add inbound rules to the security group.
Here's how:

1. In the EC2 console, select your instance and open the **Security** tab.
2. Under **Security groups**, click on your security group's link.
3. Click **Edit inbound rules**.
4. Click **Add rule** and configure:
   - **Type**: select from the dropdown (e.g. `All ICMP - IPv4` for ping, or `Custom TCP` for a specific port)
   - **Source**: `0.0.0.0/0` (all IP addresses)
5. Click **Save rules**.

Now try it: try to `ping` your instance from your local machine:

```bash
ping <instance-public-ip>
```


## :pencil2: Deploy YoloAPI on an EC2 instance

[YoloService](https://github.com/alonitac/YoloService.git) is a FastAPI-based web service that performs object detection on uploaded images using the YOLOv8 model.

**On your EC2 instance**, set up and run the service:

1. Install required system packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3.14-venv python3-pip libgl1
   ```

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alonitac/YoloService.git
   cd YoloService
   pip install -r torch-requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The service listens on port `8080`.

5. **Open port 8080 in your security group** so the service is reachable from the internet. You've done this before - add the appropriate inbound rule to your instance's security group.

**On your local machine**, download the test image (the famous Beatles image):

```bash
curl -L -o beatles.jpeg "https://github.com/alonitac/YoloService/raw/main/beatles.jpeg"
```


Then, send a `POST` request to the service to perform object detection:

```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@beatles.jpeg" http://<your-instance-public-ip>:8080/predict
```

The response will include a `uid`. Use it to retrieve the detection results:

```bash
curl -X GET http://<your-instance-public-ip>:8080/prediction/<uid>
```

Well done!
