# Intro to Kubernetes 

In this section you'll provision a Kubernetes cluster consists by **one control plane node** and **one worker node**.
Although AWS offers EKS, a managed service that simplifies cluster setup and management, we will manually set up the cluster using `kubeadm`.
This hands-on approach will allow you to gain a deeper understanding of Kubernetes architecture and the processes involved in cluster creation and configuration. 

The underlying nodes infrastructure are based on **Ubuntu EC2 instances**. Let's get started. 

## Kubernetes Architecture 

A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called **nodes**, that run containerized applications (known as **Pods**).
Every cluster has at least one **worker node** and one **control plane node**.

The control plane manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster.
In production environments, the control plane usually runs across multiple computers and a cluster usually runs multiple nodes, providing fault-tolerance and high availability.

![][k8s_components]

#### Control Plane main components

The control plane's components make global decisions about the cluster (for example, scheduling), as well as detecting and responding to cluster events (for example, starting up a new pod when a deployment's replicas field is unsatisfied).

- **kube-apiserver**: The API server is the front end for the Kubernetes control plane.
- **etcd**: Consistent and highly-available key value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.
- **kube-scheduler**: Watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node, and selects a node for them to run on.
- **kube-controller-manager**: Runs [controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-controller-manager). There are many different types of controllers. Some examples of them are:
  - Responsible for noticing and responding when nodes go down.
  - Responsible for noticing and responding when a Deployment is not in its desired state.

#### Node components

Node components run on every node, maintaining running pods and providing the Kubernetes runtime environment.

- **kubelet**: An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It makes sure that containers are running in a Pod.
- **kube-proxy**: kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster. It allows network communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside your cluster.
- **Container runtime**: It is responsible for managing the execution and lifecycle of containers ([containerd](https://containerd.io/) or [CRI-O](https://cri-o.io/)).

## Provision 2 nodes Kubernetes cluster in AWS using kubeadm

### Prepare infrastructure 

use this role (created by me + explain the role) - `kubeadm-cluster-node-role`. 

2. Launch two `t2` or `t3.medium` Ubuntu instances with `30GB` disk, naming them `<your-name>-control-plane` and `<your-name>-worker`.
3. Execute the below script **in both machines**. 

```bash
# These instructions are for Kubernetes v1.32.
KUBERNETES_VERSION=v1.32

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jq unzip ebtables ethtool -y

# install awscli
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

# Enable IPv4 packet forwarding. sysctl params required by setup, params persist across reboots
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
EOF

# Apply sysctl params without reboot
sudo sysctl --system

# Install cri-o kubelet kubeadm kubectl
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/$KUBERNETES_VERSION/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/$KUBERNETES_VERSION/deb/ /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/addons:/cri-o:/prerelease:/main/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/cri-o-apt-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/cri-o-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/addons:/cri-o:/prerelease:/main/deb/ /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cri-o.list

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gpg
sudo apt-get install -y cri-o kubelet kubeadm kubectl
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl

# start the CRIO container runtime and kubelet
sudo systemctl start crio.service
sudo systemctl enable --now crio.service
sudo systemctl enable --now kubelet

# disable swap memory
swapoff -a

# add the command to crontab to make it persistent across reboots
(crontab -l ; echo "@reboot /sbin/swapoff -a") | crontab -
```

The script essentially installs: 

- `kubeadm` - the [official Kubernetes tool](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/) that initializes the cluster and make it up and running.
- `kubelet` - a Linux service that runs on each node in the cluster, responsible for Pods lifecycle.
- `cri-o` as the container runtime.
- `kubectl` - to control the cluster.

> [!WARNING]
> In this cluster we don't use Docker as the **container runtime** (i.e. the engine that responsible to run your containers).
> We do this because Docker itself is not implementing the [Container Runtime Interface (CRI)](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/container-runtime-interface.md) required by Kubernetes. Using Docker would require an additional adapter to be installed. 
> 
> To avoid this headache, we use [CRI-O](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o), which is another great container runtime.
> 
> This should not affect the operation of your Kubernetes cluster in any way.
> Anyway, do not install Docker, as it may cause conflicts with the setup.


### Initialize the cluster 

1. From the **control-plane node**, initialize the cluster by:

```bash
sudo kubeadm init
```

2. **Carefully** read the output to understand how to start using your cluster, and how to join the worker node to be part of the cluster. 


   The `kubeadm init` command essentially does the below:
   
   1. Runs pre-flight checks.
   2. Creates certificates that used by different components for secure communication.
   3. Generates `kubeconfig` files for cluster administration.
   4. Deploys the `etcd` db as a Pod.
   5. Deploys the control plane components as Pods (`apiserver`, `controller-manager`, `scheduler`).
   6. Starts the `kubelet` as a Linux service.
   7. Install addons in the cluster (`coredns` and `kube-proxy`).

   ![][k8s_architecture_kubeadm]

   Make sure you understand the [role of each component in the architecture](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/).



> [!NOTE]
> - To run `kubeadm init` again, you must first [tear down the cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/#tear-down).
> - The join token is valid for 24 hours. Read here [how to generate a new one](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/#join-nodes) if needed.
> - For more information about initializing a cluster using `kubeadm`, [read the official docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/). 

3. Make sure you have two (not yer ready) nodes cluster by executing from the control-plane machine:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

### Install Pod networking plugin

When deploying a Kubernetes cluster, there are 2 layers of networking communication:

![][k8s_cni]

- Communication between Nodes (denoted by the green line). This is managed for us by the AWS VPC.
- Communication between Pods (denoted by the purple line). Although the communication is done on top of the VPC, communication between pods using their own cluster-internal IP address is **not** implemented for us by AWS.   

You must deploy a [Container Network Interface (CNI)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/) network add-on so that your Pods can communicate with each other. 
There are many [addons that implement the CNI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/#networking-and-network-policy). 

We'll install [Calico](https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/about/), simply by:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.28.2/manifests/calico.yaml
```

Make sure you have nodes are ready:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```


## Deploy application in the cluster

Let's see Kubernetes cluster in all his glory! 

**Online Boutique** is a microservices demo application, consists of an 11-tier microservices.
The application is a web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items, add them to the cart, and purchase them.

Here is the app architecture and description of each microservice:

![k8s_online-boutique-arch][k8s_online-boutique-arch]

| loadgenerator                 | Python/Locust | Continuously sends requests imitating realistic user shopping flows to the frontend.                                              |


To deploy the app in you cluster, perform the below command from the root directory of our course repo (make sure the YAML file exists): 

```bash 
kubectl apply -f k8s/release-0.8.0.yaml
```

By default, **applications running within the cluster are not accessible from outside the cluster.**
There are various techniques available to enable external access, we will cover some of them later on.

Using **port forwarding** allows developers to establish a temporary tunnel for debugging purposes and access applications running inside the cluster from their local machines.

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/frontend 8080:80 --address 0.0.0.0
```

Visit the service in http://<control-plane-public-ip>:8080

## Pods and namespaces


Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.
A Pod is a group of **one or more containers**, with **shared storage** and **network resources**, and a specification for how to run the containers.

You can list the Online Boutique pods by:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

Make sure all pods are `Running`. 

Pods and other resources are aggrandized in **namespaces**.
Namespace isolates resources within a cluster, usually for better organization and access control.

If you don't specify namespace, the `default` namespace is used. To list pods from all namespaces:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A
```

### :pencil2: Using `kubectl`

Use `kubectl` to answer the following questions: 

1. How many pod replicas does the **frontend** microservice have? 
2. How many **containers** does a **frontend** pod have? 
3. Use the `kubectl describe` command to get the IP address of the **frontend** pod. 
4. For the single **frontend** running pod, how many environment variables does a container named `server` have? 
5. For the single **frontend** running pod, what is the Docker image the container named `server` based on? 
6. What is the node name that the **emailservice** pod was scheduled on (by the k8s scheduler)?
7. What is the port do the **checkoutservice** pods listend on? 


### :pencil2: Pod troubleshoot I

Apply the `k8s/customers-db.yaml` to deploy a MySQL pod in the cluster.

1. When a pod is in `Pending` status, one of the first places for debugging is the pod's events. Use the `kubectl describe` to investigate the root cause for the `Pending` status of the `customers` pod.
2. Use the `kubectl describe node YOUR_NODE_NAME` to get information about the current available capacity in the node (you can also get the same information from your node's **Node details** page in the GCP console), use your common sense to modify the YAML manifest so the customers-db pod can run in the cluster. 
3. When a pod is in `CrashLoopBackOff` status, the pod's containers were started successfully, but crashed due to internal error. 
   One of the first places for debugging in the pod's logs. Print the pod's log to address the issue. 
4. Inspired by the `k8s/release-0.8.0.yaml` YAML manifest, try to add the required env var to the `k8s/customers-db.yaml` manifest to make the MySQL pod running. 


Use the `kubectl delete` command to cleanup your cluster from the resources of the `k8s/customers-db.yaml` and `k8s/release-0.8.0.yaml` manifests.
